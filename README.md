# Interactive Graphics HW2 2019 - Horse

This repository contains the code for Interactive Graphics Homework 2 from 2019. The project involves creating a WebGL-based 3D scene with animations and user interactions.

## Project Overview

The project aims to demonstrate an interactive 3D environment using WebGL technology. It utilizes vertex and fragment shaders to create visual effects and animations. The scene includes a 3D object "horse" with dynamic movement and texture mapping.

## Key Features

- **Horse Animation:** The horse animation is inspired by Eadweard Muybridge's iconic work, "The Horse in Motion". The animation showcases the horse running and jumping over obstacles. The frames of the animation are meticulously created to closely resemble the motion of a real horse.

- **Obstacle Interaction:** The horse automatically jumps when it approaches an obstacle.

- **Camera Control:** Users can control the camera's position and orientation within the 3D environment.

- **Play and Pause:** The project includes play and pause buttons, which enable users to start and stop the animation. This functionality provides better control over the experience and allows users to focus on specific moments.

- **Jump Button:** An additional interactive element is the jump button. Users can manually trigger the horse to jump.
